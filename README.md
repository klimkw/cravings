"What You Crave"

A simple program that takes online cues (such as weather) and user's input (emotions, cuisine preference, ingredients available, etc.) to either determine a craving or make a suggestion for the user's next meal.

Response from program is made with heavy emphasis on machine learning and natural language processing. A recipe embedded in a literary prose, decorated with words that hopefully sparks the reader's senses.
